    <!-- IMPORTANT! 
      This js file listed below is called key.js. It is included in the .gitignore file, so it is not added to the github repo. 
      In order to get this to work, you will need to sign up for a free google maps api key 
      See website: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#step-1-get-an-api-key 

      Click 'Get started' you have to enable billing, but it is free so long as you dont do more than like 150,000 requests this month

      You can set max requests, and not be billed no matter what, but this is done for security reasons, explained in 290, 
      basically so none of us can post this on reddit and accidentally give a teammate a surprise million views and a $50 charge

      After you have your api key, create a file called key.js in the same folder as this html doc, add a single line to it. It will look like: 
      const APIkey = '(copy and paste your api key here)'
      Then, this will work on your home computer -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="key.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      google.charts.load('current', {
        'packages':['geochart'],
        // Note: you will need to get a mapsApiKey for your project.
        // See: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/basic_load_libs#load-settings
        'mapsApiKey': APIkey
      });
      google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawRegionsMap);

      function drawRegionsMap() {
        var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
          ['Country', 'Popularity'],
          ['Germany', 2000],
          ['United States', 300],
          ['Brazil', 400],

          ['Russia', 100]
        ]);

        var options = {};

        var chart = new google.visualization.GeoChart(document.getElementById('regions_div'));

        chart.draw(data, options);
